# Project Name: Tracing Journeys: Visualizing 30 years of Global Migration and Population Change

**Author:** Magdalena Barros

## Description

This project offers an interactive exploration of global migration and population changes between 1990 and 2020. Through two visualizations, you can explore:

1. **Migration and Immigration Percentages**: Shows how the percentages of people migrating and immigrating, in relation to the total population, have changed over the years.
2. **Interactive Map**: Displays the change in population and the destinations people are moving to from their country of origin. You can filter by country or view global trends.

Designed to be a useful tool for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding migration patterns over time.
