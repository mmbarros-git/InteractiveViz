UN
International Migrant Stock 2020

The estimates of the number (or “stock”) of international migrants disaggregated 
by age, sex and country or area of origin are based on national statistics, 
in most cases obtained from population censuses. Additionally, population registers 
and nationally representative surveys provided information on the number and 
composition of international migrants.

The dataset presents estimates of international migrant by age, sex and origin. 
Estimates are presented for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 and are 
available for 232 countries and areas of the world. The estimates are based on official 
statistics on the foreign-born or the foreign population.
